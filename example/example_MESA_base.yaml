# example_MESA_base.yaml
# Configuration for mesalab - Example Analysis Workflow for analyzing blue loop crossings.

# --- Required Input/Output Paths ---
# These are essential for mesalab to find your MESA data and save results.
# IMPORTANT: Replace these with your actual paths!
# This setup does not need the installation of MESASDK or GYRE.

# --- General Settings ---
general_settings:
  # The base directory containing your MESA run subdirectories (e.g., '1.0M_solar/Z0.01/'),
  # each with its 'LOGS' and 'profiles.data' files.
  input_dir: MESA_grid

  # The base directory where all mesalab outputs (analysis results, plots) will be saved.
  output_dir: MESA_grid_base_output

  # The common part of the MESA inlist filename (i.e., 'inlist_project' in this case).
  inlist_name: "inlist_project"

  # If you've run a full analysis before and the 'detail_z*.csv' files exist,
  # set this to 'false' to skip re-processing the detailed MESA profiles, speeding things up.
  # Set to 'true' to force a complete reanalysis from scratch, recalculating all derived quantities.
  force_reanalysis: True

  # Set to 'true' for highly verbose logging output (DEBUG level) suitable for development and troubleshooting.
  # Set to 'false' to reduce log verbosity, showing only INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL messages for regular operation.
  debug: False

# --- Analysis Options ---
blue_loop_analysis:
  # This is CRITICAL for blue loop analyzis and plotting. Setting this to 'true' ensures
  # the detailed blue loop analysis data is generated and processed.
  analyze_blue_loop: True

  # Defines the columns saved in the detailed blue loop CSV files.
  # 'all' saves all relevant columns from the blue loop phase.
  # 'summary' saves only a condensed set of key columns (e.g., star_age, log_Teff, log_L).
  blue_loop_output_type: "summary"

# --- Plotting Specific Settings ---
plotting_settings:
  # Set to 'true' to enable heatmap generation for cross-grid data (if applicable).
  generate_heatmaps: True

  # This controls the generation of the main HR diagrams for your MESA tracks.
  # Options:
  #   - 'none': (or omit this line entirely) Does NOT generate HR diagrams.
  #   - 'all': Generates standard HRDs with full evolutionary tracks (including pre-main sequence).
  #   - 'drop_zams': Generates HRDs where the pre-main sequence (ZAMS) phase is trimmed,
  #                  focusing on the post-ZAMS evolution.
  generate_hr_diagrams: "all"

  # Set to 'true' to generate specific blue loop HRD/CMD/logg-L plots
  # that include bolometric corrections, providing detailed visual analysis
  # of the blue loop phase. Requires 'analyze_blue_loop: True'.
  generate_blue_loop_plots_with_bc: True


# --- GYRE Workflow Specific Settings ---
# This section controls the execution of the GYRE pulsation analysis.
gyre_workflow:
  # Set to 'false', all other GYRE settings in this section will be ignored.
  run_gyre_workflow: False

# --- RSP Workflow Specific Settings ---
rsp_workflow:
  # Set to 'false', all other RSP settings in this section will be ignored.
  run_rsp_workflow: False
